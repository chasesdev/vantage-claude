```

### Data Flow Example
```
1. User downloads Expo app → Signs up (Clerk)
2. Connects Apple Health/Garmin → Auto-sync daily
3. Scans medical records → AI extracts biomarkers (OCR + LLM)
4. Books session at retail location
5. Checks in via QR code → Workstation notified
6. Session starts → Real-time updates to mobile app
   - See 3D VIS room visualization
   - Activity feed updates live
   - AI reasoning displayed transparently
7. Devices capture data → Workstation processes
8. Workstation syncs to cloud → Heavy AI analysis
9. Cloud generates comprehensive report
