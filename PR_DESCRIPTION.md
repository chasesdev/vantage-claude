## Data Flow Example

```
1. User downloads Expo app → Signs up (Clerk)
2. Connects Apple Health/Garmin → Auto-sync daily
3. Scans medical records → AI extracts biomarkers (OCR + LLM)
4. Books session at retail location
5. Checks in via QR code → Workstation notified
6. Session starts → Real-time updates to mobile app
   - See 3D VIS room visualization (simplified for mobile)
   - Activity feed updates live ("Platform rotating...", "Capturing image...")
   - AI reasoning displayed transparently
7. Devices capture data → Jetson preprocesses → Workstation processes
8. Workstation syncs to cloud → RunPod DGX heavy AI analysis
